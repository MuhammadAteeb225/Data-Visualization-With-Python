# Data-Visualization-With-Python

Data visualization is the graphical representation of data in order to interactively and efficiently convey insights to clients, customers, and stakeholders in general. It is a way to summarize your findings and display it in a form that facilitates interpretation and can help in identifying patterns or trends. In this course you will learn how to create interesting graphics and charts and customize them to make them more effective and more pleasing to your audience.

## Syllabus

### Week 1 - Introduction to Data Visualization Tools

In this module, you will learn about data visualization and some of the best practices to keep in mind when creating plots and visuals. You will also learn about the history and the architecture of Matplotlib and learn about basic plotting with Matplotlib. In addition, you will learn about the dataset on immigration to Canada, which will be used extensively throughout the course. Finally, you will briefly learn how to read csv files into a pandas dataframe and process and manipulate the data in the dataframe, and how to generate line plots using Matplotlib.

- Introduction to Data Visualization
- Introduction to Matplotlib
- Basic Plotting with Matplotlib
- Dataset on Immigration to Canada
- Line Plots

### Week 2 - Basic and Specialized Visualization Tools

In this module, you learn about area plots and how to create them with Matplotlib, histograms and how to create them with Matplotlib, bar charts, and how to create them with Matplotlib, pie charts, and how to create them with Matplotlib, box plots and how to create them with Matplotlib, and scatter plots and bubble plots and how to create them with Matplotlib.

- Area Plots
- Histograms
- Bar Charts
- Pie Charts
- Box Plots
- Scatter Plots

### Week 3 - Advanced Visualizations and Geospatial Data

In this module, you will learn about advanced visualization tools such as waffle charts and word clouds and how to create them. You will also learn about seaborn, which is another visualization library, and how to use it to generate attractive regression plots. In addition, you will learn about Folium, which is another visualization library, designed especially for visualizing geospatial data. Finally, you will learn how to use Folium to create maps of different regions of the world and how to superimpose markers on top of a map, and how to create choropleth maps.

- Waffle Charts
- Word Clouds
- Seaborn and Regression Plots
- Introduction to Folium
- Maps with Markers
- Choropleth Maps

### Week 4 - Creating Dashboards with Plotly and Dash

In this module you will get started with dashboard creation using the Plotly library. You will create a dashboard with a theme US Domestic Airline Flights Performance. You will do this using a US airline reporting carrier on-time performance dataset, Plotly, and Dash concepts learned throughout the course.

- Dashboarding Overview
- Introduction to Plotly
- Introduction to Dash
- Interactive Dashboards

### Week 5 - Final Assignment

In this Assignment, you will demonstrate the data visualization skills you learned by completing this course.   Dashboard is based on the concept of demonstrating US Domestic Airline Flights Performance and Yearly average flight delay statistics for a given year ( 2005 to 2020).
